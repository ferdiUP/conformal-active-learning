# Conformal active learning

This repository contains first toy experiments to illlustrate the behaviour of Conformal Prediction (CP) different machine learning tasks. 
The first scripts allows to compare marginal, Mondrian and selection-conditional set-valued inference.
Learning curves of black-box models can be extracted.

### Label-conditional CP

### Advanced $p$-value analysis
